## Hack Together: Microsoft Graph and .NET ü¶í

From March 1-15, 2023 we ran **Hack Together: Microsoft Graph and .NET** - a virtual hackathon for beginners to get started building scenario-based apps using .NET and Microsoft Graph.

In this hackathon, participants learned how to build apps with Microsoft Graph based on top Microsoft Graph scenarios, and met Microsoft Graph Product Group Leaders, Cloud Advocates, MVPs and Student Ambassadors. Each submitted app had a chance to win exciting prizes.
